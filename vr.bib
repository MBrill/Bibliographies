	a high level of feeling presence in the displayed game environment.
	Virtual reality (VR) technologies have enormous potential to enhance
	gameplay since players can experience the game immersively from the
	perspective of the player's virtual character. However, the VR technology
	itself, such as tracking devices and cabling, has until recently
	restricted the ability of users to really walk over long distances.
	
	 In this paper we introduce a VR-based user interface for presence-enhancing
	gameplay with which players can explore the game environment in the
	most natural way, i. e., by real walking. While the player walks
	through the virtual game environment, we guide him/her on a physical
	path which is different from the virtual path and fits into the VR
	laboratory space. In order to further increase the VR experience,
	we introduce the concept of transitional environments. Such a transitional
	environment is a virtual replica of the laboratory environment, where
	the VR experience starts and which enables a gradual transition to
	the game environment. We have quantified how much humans can unknowingly
	be redirected and whether or not a gradual transition to a first-person
	game via a transitional environment increases the user's sense of
	presence.},

	The technique has been initially developed for users standing in

	and tracking equipments.
	
	
	 In this paper, we propose to revisit the whole pipeline of the Walking-In-Place
	technique to match a larger set of configurations and apply it notably
	to the context of desktop Virtual Reality. With our novel "Shake-Your-Head"
	technique, the user is left with the possibility to sit down, and
	to use small screens and standard input devices such as a basic webcam
	for tracking. The locomotion simulation can compute various motions
	such as turning, jumping and crawling, using as sole input the head
	movements of the user. We also introduce the use of additional visual
	feedback based on camera motions to enhance the walking sensations.
	
	
	 An experiment was conducted to compare our technique with classical
	input devices used for navigating in desktop VR. Interestingly, the
	results showed that our technique could even allow faster navigations
	when sitting, after a short learning. Our technique was also perceived
	as more fun and increasing presence, and was generally more appreciated
	for VR navigation.},

	the device in terms of its construction and operating characteristics.
	We then report on an analysis consisting of a series of locomotion
	and maneuvering tasks on the ODT. We observed user motions and system
	responses to those motions from the perspective of the user. Each
	task is described in terms of what causes certain motions to trigger
	unpredictable responses causing loss of balance or at least causing
	the user to become consciously aware of their movements. We conclude

	and machine control mechanism for centering the user on the treads.}

  abstract = {When an immersive virtual environment represents a space that is larger
	than the available space within which a user can travel by directly
	walking, it becomes necessary to consider alternative methods for
	traveling through that space. The traditional solution is to require
	the user to travel ‘indirectly’, using a device that changes his
	viewpoint in the environment without actually requiring him to move
	– for example, a joystick. However, other solutions involving variations
	on direct walking are also possible.
	
	 In this paper, we present a new metaphor for natural, augmented direct
	locomotion through moderately large-scale immersive virtual environments
	(IVEs) presented via head mounted display systems, which we call
	seven league boots. The key characteristic of this method is that
	it involves determining a user’s intended direction of travel and
	then augmenting only the component of his or her motion that is aligned
	with that direction.
	
	 After reviewing previously proposed methods for enabling intuitive
	locomotion through large IVEs, we begin by describing the technical
	implementation details of our novel method, discussing the various
	alternative options that we explored and parameters that we varied
	in an attempt to attain optimal performance. We then present the
	results of a pilot observer experiment that we conducted in an attempt
	to obtain objective, qualitative insight into the relative strengths
	and weaknesses of our new method, in comparison to the three most
	commonly used alternative locomotion methods: flying, via use of
	a wand; normal walking, with a uniform gain applied to the output
	of the tracker; and normal walking without gain, but with the location
	and orientation of the larger virtual environment periodically adjusted
	relative to position of the participant in the real environment.
	In this study we found, among other things, that for travel down
	a long, straight virtual hallway, participants overwhelmingly preferred
	the seven league boots method to the other methods, overall.}

	that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's
	real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves.
	Furthermore, it has been shown that when users start their virtual
	reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and then gradually
	transition to a different VE, their sense of presence in the actual
	virtual world increases significantly. In this case the virtual replica
	serves as a transitional environment between the real and virtual
	world.
	
	 In this paper we examine whether a person's distance estimation skills
	can be transferred from a transitional environment to a different
	VE. We have conducted blind walking experiments to analyze if starting
	the VR experience in a transitional environment can improve a person's
	ability to estimate distances in an immersive VR system. We found
	that users significantly improve their distance estimation skills
	when they enter the virtual world via a transitional environment.},

  abstract  = {In order to increase a user's sense of presence in an artificial environment
	some researchers propose a gradual transition from reality to the
	virtual world instead of immersing users into the virtual world directly.
	One approach is to start the VR experience in a virtual replica of
	the physical space to accustom users to the characteristics of VR,
	e.g., latency, reduced field of view or tracking errors, in a known
	environment. Although this procedure is already applied in VR demonstrations,
	until now it has not been verified whether the usage of such a transitional
	environment - as transition between real and virtual environment
	- increases someone's sense of presence. We have observed subjective,
	physiological and behavioral reactions of subjects during a fully-immersive
	flight phobia experiment under two different conditions: the virtual
	flight environment was displayed immediately, or subjects visited
	a transitional environment before entering the virtual flight environment.
	We have quantified to what extent a gradual transition to the VE
	via a transitional environment increases the level of presence. We
	have found that subjective responses show significantly higher scores
	for the user's sense of presence, and that subjects' behavioral reactions
	change when a transitional environment is shown first. Considering
	physiological reactions, no significant difference could be found.},

	 Redirected Walking addresses this limitation by interactively and
	imperceptibly rotating the virtual scene about the user. The rotation
	causes the user to walk continually toward the furthest wall of the
	lab without noticing the rotation. We implemented the technique using
	stereo graphics and 3D spatialized audio. Observations during a pilot

	people to change their real walking direction without noticing it,

	course of a motion, the peak velocity occurs; and peak deceleration.
	2) Correlations of those critical value data for the conditions taken

	3) Task performance varies with interface condition, but correlations
	of that value for conditions taken pairwise do not cluster by naturalness.

	is suitable for applications where locomotion is restricted to ground
	level. The technique is derived from the idea that presence in virtual
	environments may be enhanced the stronger the match between proprioceptive
	information from human body movements and sensory feedback from the
	computer-generated displays. The technique is an attempt to simulate
	body movements associated with walking. The participant “walks in
	place” to move through the virtual environment across distances greater
	than the physical limitations imposed by the electromagnetic tracking
	devices. A neural network is used to analyze the stream of coordinates
	from the head-mounted display, to determine whether or not the participant
	is walking on the spot. Whenever it determines the walking behavior,
	the participant is moved through virtual space in the direction of
	his or her gaze. We discuss two experimental studies to assess the
	impact on presence of this method in comparison to the usual hand-pointing
	method of navigation in virtual reality. The studies suggest that
	subjective rating of presence is enhanced by the walking method provided
	that participants associate subjectively with the virtual body provided

  abstract     = {One of the main goals of virtual reality is to provide immersive environments that take
participants away from the real life into a virtual one. Many investigators have been interested in
bringing new technologies, devices, and applications to facilitate this goal. Few, however, have
focused on the specific human–computer interaction aspects of such environments. In this article
we present our literature review of virtual reality and the Cave Automated Virtual Environment
(CAVE). In particular, the article begins by providing a brief overview of the evolution of virtual
reality. In addition, key elements of a virtual reality system are presented along with a proposed
taxonomy that categorizes such systems from the perspective of technologies used and the mental
immersion level found in these systems. Moreover, a detailed overview of the CAVE is presented in
terms of its characteristics, uses, and mainly, the interaction styles inside it. Insights of the interaction
challenges and research directions of investigating interaction with virtual reality systems in
general and the CAVE in particular are thoroughly discussed as well.},

  abstract  = {Advances in tracking technology and wireless headsets enable walking as a means of locomotion in Virtual Reality. When exploring virtual environments larger than room-scale, it is often desirable to increase users' perceived walking speed, for which we investigate three methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users' avatar size, allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling enables users to walk through a World in Miniature, while maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots amplifies users' movements along their walking path. We conduct a study comparing these methods and find that users feel most embodied using Ground-Level Scaling and consequently increase their stride length. Using Seven-League Boots, unlike the other two methods, diminishes positional accuracy at high gains, and users modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack of control. We conclude with a discussion on each technique's strength and weaknesses and the types of situation they might be appropriate for.},

In this paper, we present DreamWalker, a VR system that enables such real world walking while users explore and stay fully immersed inside large virtual environments in a headset. Provided with a real-world destination, DreamWalker ﬁnds a similar path in a pre-authored VR environment and guides the user while real walking the virtual world. To keep the user from colliding with objects and people in the real-world, DreamWalker’s tracking system fuses GPS locations, inside-out tracking, and RGBD frames to 1) continuously and accurately position the user in the real world, 2) sense walkable paths and obstacles in real time, and 3) represent paths through a dynamically changing scene in VR to redirect the user towards the chosen destination. We demonstrate DreamWalker’s versatility by enabling users to walk three paths across the large Microsoft campus while enjoying pre-authored VR worlds, supplemented with a variety of obstacle avoidance and redirection techniques. In our evaluation, 8 participants walked across campus along a 15-minute route, experiencing a virtual Manhattan that was full of animated cars, people, and other objects.},

However, it has barely been investigated so far how the user interface (UI) can cope with the challenges of the vision-based localization technique, such as varying quality of the query images. We implemented a novel UI for visual localization, consisting of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) views that actively communicate and ensure localization accuracy. If necessary, the system encourages the user to point the smartphone at distinctive regions to improve localization quality. We evaluated the UI in a experimental navigation task with a prototype, informed by initial evaluation results using design mockups. We found that VR can contribute to efficient and effective indoor navigation even at unreliable location and orientation accuracy. We discuss identified challenges and share lessons learned as recommendations for future work.},

The C3 presents two modes, one with the graphical display of the cubic structure associated to the C3 and a blind mode for expert users, with no feedback. In this paper we conduct formal tests of the C3 under four different conditions: the visual mode with the graphical display, the blind mode with no feedback and two additional conditions enhancing the expert blind mode: a tactile mode with the tactile feedback of a Cyberglove and a sound mode with a standard audio device. Results show that the addition of sound and tactil feedback is more disturbing to the users than the blind mode. The visual mode performs the best although the blind mode achieves some promising results.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the use of a handheld spherical object as a controller for locomotion in VR. Rotating the object controls avatar movement in two different ways: As a zero order controller, it is continuously rotated to the target position as if rolling a ball on the floor. As a first order controller, it is tilted like a joystick to determine the direction and speed of movement. We describe how our prototype was built from low-cost commercially available hardware and discuss our design decisions. Then we evaluate both locomotion techniques in a user study (N=20) and compare them to established methods using handheld VR controllers. Our prototype matched and in some cases outperformed these methods regarding task time and accuracy. All results were obtained without any usage instructions, indicating easy learnability. Some of our insights may transfer to interaction with other naturally shaped objects in VR experiences.},

  abstract = {Various interaction techniques have been developed in the field of virtual and augmented reality. Whereas techniques for object selection, manipulation, travel, and wayfinding have already been covered in existing taxonomies in some detail, application control techniques have not yet been sufficiently considered. However, they are needed by almost every mixed reality application, e.g. for choosing from alternative objects or options. For this purpose a great variety of distinct three-dimensional (3D) menu selection techniques is available. This paper surveys existing 3D menus from the corpus of literature and classifies them according to various criteria. The taxonomy introduced here assists developers of interactive 3D applications to better evaluate their options when choosing, optimizing, and implementing a 3D menu technique. Since the taxonomy spans the design space for 3D menu solutions, it also aids researchers in identifying opportunities to improve or create novel virtual menu techniques.},

Specifically, we present five design challenges inspired by analysis of human-human communication that are mundanely addressed by traditional graphical user interface designs (GUIs). Although classic GUI conventions allow us to finesse these questions, recent research into innovative interaction techniques such as 'Ubiquitous Computing' and 'Tangible Interfaces' has begun to expose the interaction challenges and problems they pose. By making them explicit we open a discourse on how an approach similar to that used by social scientists in studying human-human interaction might inform the design of novel interaction mechanisms that can be used to handle human-computer communication accomplishments},

  abstract  = {Past research has proposed various hand redirection techniques for virtual reality (VR). Such techniques modify a user’s hand movements and have been successfully used to enhance haptics and 3D user interfaces. Up to now, however, no unified framework exists that implements previously proposed techniques such as body warping, world warping, and hybrid methods. In this work, we present the Virtual Reality Hand Redirection Toolkit (HaRT), an open-source framework developed for the Unity engine. The toolkit aims to support both novice and expert VR researchers and practitioners in implementing and evaluating hand redirection techniques. It provides implementations of popular redirection algorithms and exposes a modular class hierarchy for easy integration of new approaches. Moreover, simulation, logging, and visualization features allow users of the toolkit to analyze hand redirection setups with minimal technical effort. We present the architecture of the toolkit along with the results of a qualitative expert study.},
