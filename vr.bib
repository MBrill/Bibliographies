  abstract = {For most first-person video games it is important that players have
	a high level of feeling presence in the displayed game environment.
	Virtual reality (VR) technologies have enormous potential to enhance
	gameplay since players can experience the game immersively from the
	perspective of the player's virtual character. However, the VR technology
	itself, such as tracking devices and cabling, has until recently
	restricted the ability of users to really walk over long distances.
	
	 In this paper we introduce a VR-based user interface for presence-enhancing
	gameplay with which players can explore the game environment in the
	most natural way, i. e., by real walking. While the player walks
	through the virtual game environment, we guide him/her on a physical
	path which is different from the virtual path and fits into the VR
	laboratory space. In order to further increase the VR experience,
	we introduce the concept of transitional environments. Such a transitional
	environment is a virtual replica of the laboratory environment, where
	the VR experience starts and which enables a gradual transition to
	the game environment. We have quantified how much humans can unknowingly
	be redirected and whether or not a gradual transition to a first-person
	game via a transitional environment increases the user's sense of
	presence.},

	The technique has been initially developed for users standing in

	and tracking equipments.
	
	
	 In this paper, we propose to revisit the whole pipeline of the Walking-In-Place
	technique to match a larger set of configurations and apply it notably
	to the context of desktop Virtual Reality. With our novel "Shake-Your-Head"
	technique, the user is left with the possibility to sit down, and
	to use small screens and standard input devices such as a basic webcam
	for tracking. The locomotion simulation can compute various motions
	such as turning, jumping and crawling, using as sole input the head
	movements of the user. We also introduce the use of additional visual
	feedback based on camera motions to enhance the walking sensations.
	
	
	 An experiment was conducted to compare our technique with classical
	input devices used for navigating in desktop VR. Interestingly, the
	results showed that our technique could even allow faster navigations
	when sitting, after a short learning. Our technique was also perceived
	as more fun and increasing presence, and was generally more appreciated
	for VR navigation.},

	the device in terms of its construction and operating characteristics.
	We then report on an analysis consisting of a series of locomotion
	and maneuvering tasks on the ODT. We observed user motions and system
	responses to those motions from the perspective of the user. Each
	task is described in terms of what causes certain motions to trigger
	unpredictable responses causing loss of balance or at least causing
	the user to become consciously aware of their movements. We conclude
	that the two primary shortcomings in the ODT are its tracking system
	and machine control mechanism for centering the user on the treads.}

  booktitle = {In Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI},
  year = {2007},
  publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
  abstract = {When an immersive virtual environment represents a space that is larger
	than the available space within which a user can travel by directly
	walking, it becomes necessary to consider alternative methods for
	traveling through that space. The traditional solution is to require
	the user to travel ‘indirectly’, using a device that changes his
	viewpoint in the environment without actually requiring him to move
	– for example, a joystick. However, other solutions involving variations
	on direct walking are also possible.
	
	 In this paper, we present a new metaphor for natural, augmented direct
	locomotion through moderately large-scale immersive virtual environments
	(IVEs) presented via head mounted display systems, which we call
	seven league boots. The key characteristic of this method is that
	it involves determining a user’s intended direction of travel and
	then augmenting only the component of his or her motion that is aligned
	with that direction.
	
	 After reviewing previously proposed methods for enabling intuitive
	locomotion through large IVEs, we begin by describing the technical
	implementation details of our novel method, discussing the various
	alternative options that we explored and parameters that we varied
	in an attempt to attain optimal performance. We then present the
	results of a pilot observer experiment that we conducted in an attempt
	to obtain objective, qualitative insight into the relative strengths
	and weaknesses of our new method, in comparison to the three most
	commonly used alternative locomotion methods: flying, via use of
	a wand; normal walking, with a uniform gain applied to the output
	of the tracker; and normal walking without gain, but with the location
	and orientation of the larger virtual environment periodically adjusted
	relative to position of the participant in the real environment.
	In this study we found, among other things, that for travel down
	a long, straight virtual hallway, participants overwhelmingly preferred
	the seven league boots method to the other methods, overall.}

	are perceived as compressed in immersive virtual environments relative

	have remained largely unknown. However, recent experiments suggest
	that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's
	real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves.
	Furthermore, it has been shown that when users start their virtual
	reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and then gradually
	transition to a different VE, their sense of presence in the actual
	virtual world increases significantly. In this case the virtual replica
	serves as a transitional environment between the real and virtual

	 In this paper we examine whether a person's distance estimation skills
	can be transferred from a transitional environment to a different
	VE. We have conducted blind walking experiments to analyze if starting
	the VR experience in a transitional environment can improve a person's
	ability to estimate distances in an immersive VR system. We found
	that users significantly improve their distance estimation skills
	when they enter the virtual world via a transitional environment.},

  abstract = {In order to increase a user's sense of presence in an artificial environment
	some researchers propose a gradual transition from reality to the
	virtual world instead of immersing users into the virtual world directly.
	One approach is to start the VR experience in a virtual replica of
	the physical space to accustom users to the characteristics of VR,
	e.g., latency, reduced field of view or tracking errors, in a known
	environment. Although this procedure is already applied in VR demonstrations,
	until now it has not been verified whether the usage of such a transitional
	environment - as transition between real and virtual environment
	- increases someone's sense of presence. We have observed subjective,
	physiological and behavioral reactions of subjects during a fully-immersive
	flight phobia experiment under two different conditions: the virtual
	flight environment was displayed immediately, or subjects visited
	a transitional environment before entering the virtual flight environment.
	We have quantified to what extent a gradual transition to the VE
	via a transitional environment increases the level of presence. We
	have found that subjective responses show significantly higher scores
	for the user's sense of presence, and that subjects' behavioral reactions
	change when a transitional environment is shown first. Considering
	physiological reactions, no significant difference could be found.},

	a high subjective sense of presence, limits virtual environments
	to the size of the tracked space.
	
	 Redirected Walking addresses this limitation by interactively and
	imperceptibly rotating the virtual scene about the user. The rotation
	causes the user to walk continually toward the furthest wall of the
	lab without noticing the rotation. We implemented the technique using
	stereo graphics and 3D spatialized audio. Observations during a pilot
	study suggest that the technique works: Redirected Walking causes
	people to change their real walking direction without noticing it,
	allows for larger VEs, and does not induce appreciable simulator
	sickness.}

	natural vision). We identified metrics and collected data that captured
	task performance and the underlying kinematics of the task.
	
	 Our results show: 1) Over 95% of the variance in simple motion paths
	is captured in three critical values: peak velocity; when, in the
	course of a motion, the peak velocity occurs; and peak deceleration.
	2) Correlations of those critical value data for the conditions taken
	pairwise suggest a coarse ordering of locomotion interfaces by “naturalness.”
	3) Task performance varies with interface condition, but correlations
	of that value for conditions taken pairwise do not cluster by naturalness.
	4) The perceptual variable, τ (also known as the time-to-contact)
	calculated at the point of peak deceleration has higher correlation
	with task performance than τ calculated at peak velocity.},

	environments may be enhanced the stronger the match between proprioceptive
	information from human body movements and sensory feedback from the
	computer-generated displays. The technique is an attempt to simulate
	body movements associated with walking. The participant “walks in
	place” to move through the virtual environment across distances greater
	than the physical limitations imposed by the electromagnetic tracking
	devices. A neural network is used to analyze the stream of coordinates
	from the head-mounted display, to determine whether or not the participant
	is walking on the spot. Whenever it determines the walking behavior,
	the participant is moved through virtual space in the direction of
	his or her gaze. We discuss two experimental studies to assess the
	impact on presence of this method in comparison to the usual hand-pointing
	method of navigation in virtual reality. The studies suggest that
	subjective rating of presence is enhanced by the walking method provided
	that participants associate subjectively with the virtual body provided
	in the environment. An application of the technique to climbing steps
