  abstract = {This paper evaluates the combination of two methods for adapting bipedal
	locomotion to explore virtual environments displayed on head-mounted
	displays (HMDs) within the confines of limited tracking spaces. We
	combine a method of changing the optic flow of locomotion, effectively
	scaling the translational gain, with a method of intervening and
	manipulating a user's locations in physical space while preserving
	their spatial awareness of the virtual space. This latter technique
	is called resetting. In two experiments, we evaluate both scaling
	the translational gain and resetting while a subject locomotes along
	a path and then turns to face a remembered object. We find that the
	two techniques can be effectively combined, although there is a cognitive
	cost to resetting.},
