  abstract = {This paper evaluates the combination of two methods for adapting bipedal
	locomotion to explore virtual environments displayed on head-mounted
	displays (HMDs) within the confines of limited tracking spaces. We
	combine a method of changing the optic flow of locomotion, effectively
	scaling the translational gain, with a method of intervening and
	manipulating a user's locations in physical space while preserving
	their spatial awareness of the virtual space. This latter technique
	is called resetting. In two experiments, we evaluate both scaling
	the translational gain and resetting while a subject locomotes along
	a path and then turns to face a remembered object. We find that the
	two techniques can be effectively combined, although there is a cognitive
	cost to resetting.},

  abstract  = {One of the most fundamental features of scientific visualization is the process of mapping scalar values to colors. This process allows us to view scalar fields by coloring surfaces and volumes. Unfortunately, the majority of scientific visualization tools still use a color map that is famous for its ineffectiveness: the rainbow color map. This color map, which na{\"i}vely sweeps through the most saturated colors, is well known for its ability to obscure data, introduce artifacts, and confuse users. Although many alternate color maps have been proposed, none have achieved widespread adoption by the visualization community for scientific visualization. This paper explores the use of diverging color maps (sometimes also called ratio, bipolar, or double-ended color maps) for use in scientific visualization, provides a diverging color map that generally performs well in scientific visualization applications, and presents an algorithm that allows users to easily generate their own customized color maps.},
