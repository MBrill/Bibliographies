	is unique. Alternative class of kernels called conditionally positive
	definite have been studied for a long time from the theoretical point
	of view and have drawn attention from the community only in the last

  abstract = {Capturing surface appearance is important for a large number of applications.
	Appearance of real world surfaces is difficult to model as it varies
	with the direction of illumination as well as the direction from
	which it is viewed. Consequently, measurements of the BRDF (bidirectional
	reflectance distribution function) have been important. In addition,
	many applications require measuring how the entire surface reflects
	light, i.e. spatially varying BRDF measurements are important as
	well. For compactness we refer to a spatially varying BRDF as a BTF
	(bidirectional texture function). Measurements of BRDF and/or BTF
	typically require signifcant resources in time and equipment. In
	this work, a device for BRDF/BTF measurement is presented that is
	compact, economical and convenient. The device uses the approach
	of curved mirrors to remove the need for hemispherical positioning
	of the camera and illumination source. Instead, simple planar translations
	of optical components are used to vary the illumination direction
	and to scan the surface. Furthermore, the measurement process is
	fast because the device enables simultaneous measurements of multiple

  abstract = {Manifold bootstrapping is a new method for data-driven modeling of
	real-world, spatially-varying reflectance, based on the idea that
	reflectance over a given material sample forms a low-dimensional
	manifold. It provides a high-resolution result in both the spatial
	and angular domains by decomposing reflectance measurement into two
	lower-dimensional phases. The first acquires representatives of high
	angular dimension but sampled sparsely over the surface, while the
	second acquires keys of low angular dimension but sampled densely
	over the surface.
	
	
	We develop a hand-held, high-speed BRDF capturing device for phase
	one measurements. A condenser-based optical setup collects a dense
	hemisphere of rays emanating from a single point on the target sample
	as it is manually scanned over it, yielding 10 BRDF point measurements
	per second. Lighting directions from 6 LEDs are applied at each measurement;
	these are amplified to a full 4D BRDF using the general (NDF-tabulated)
	microfacet model. The second phase captures N=20-200 images of the
	entire sample from a fixed view and lit by a varying area source.
	We show that the resulting N-dimensional keys capture much of the
	distance information in the original BRDF space, so that they effectively
	discriminate among representatives, though they lack sufficient angular
	detail to reconstruct the SVBRDF by themselves. At each surface position,
	a local linear combination of a small number of neighboring representatives
	is computed to match each key, yielding a high-resolution SVBRDF.
	A quick capture session (10-20 minutes) on simple devices yields
	results showing sharp and anisotropic specularity and rich spatial
	detail.},

	The academic community has researched several models over the last
	century, but for the most part, we are still stuck with the most
	basic of models. The reason for this is for the most part the lack
	of computational power, making it difficult to use more truthful
	models in real-time. The goal of this paper is to investigate the
	viability of some of the
	
	more sophisticated surface reflection models that have been created,
	giving developers a sense as to how much computational power needs
	to be used to create better looking surfaces.
	
	Traditionally, the most used method of finding the color of a pixel
	has been through Gouraud interpolation of Lambert's Cosine Law at
	the vertices. This lighting model is extremely cheap to compute and
	is amenable to fixed function pipelines. With the advent of GPUs,
	Phong interpolation has become a viable option. This model has allowed
	for innovations like bump mapping giving more realism to modern virtual
	worlds. The underlying assumptions however are still the same; the
	surfaces are Lambertian.
	
	Unfortunately, this has the side effect of making most of the computer
	generated images look very much alike, and very different from the
	real world. The Lambertian surface assumption works great for some
	materials (like plastic), which means that different models must
	be used if other materials are to be represented faithfully. And
	this is what we will investigate over the next few pages.},

	In the 1990s, a new type of learning algorithm was developed, based
	on results from statistical learning theory: the Support Vector Machine
	(SVM). This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning
	machines that use a central concept of SVMs - kernels - for a number
	of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that
	can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the
	kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural
	networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information
	retrieval, and bioinformatics. This volume provides an introduction
	to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with
	the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all
	of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic
	mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using
	theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and
	to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed.},

	accommodates self-shadowing, interreflection, and masking effects

	explicit representation of the small scale geometry. Our method represents

	decomposed into a product of three or more two-dimensional positive

	The main benefit of CMF is that it delivers factors well suited for

  title = {Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation},
  school = {Standford University},
  year = {1997},
  abstract = {Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating
	the emission and scattering
	
	of light in an artificial environment. Applications include lighting
	design, architecture,
	
	and computer animation, while related engineering disciplines include
	neutron transport and
	
	radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with these algorithms
	is the high complexity of
	
	the geometric, scattering, and illumination models that are typically
	used. In this dissertation,
	
	we develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the range
	of input models
	
	for which light transport simulations are practical. Our contributions
	include new theoretical
	
	models, statistical methods, and rendering algorithms.
	
	We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional
	light transport algorithms
	
	(those that combine direct and adjoint techniques). First, we propose
	a linear operator
	
	formulation that does not depend on any assumptions about the physical
	validity of
	
	the input scene. We show how to obtain mathematically correct results
	using a variety of
	
	bidirectional techniques. Next we derive a different formulation,
	such that for any physically
	
	valid input scene, the transport operators are symmetric. This symmetry
	is important
	
	for both theory and implementations, and is based on a new reciprocity
	condition that we
	
	derive for transmissive materials. Finally, we show how light transport
	can be formulated as
	
	an integral over a space of paths. This framework allows new sampling
	and integration techniques
	
	to be applied, such as the Metropolis sampling algorithm. We also
	use this model to
	
	investigate the limitations of unbiased Monte Carlo methods, and to
	show that certain kinds
	
	of paths cannot be sampled.
	
	Our statistical contributions include a new technique called multiple
	importance sampling,
	
	which can greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration.
	It uses more
	
	than one sampling technique to evaluate an integral, and then combines
	these samples in a
	
	vii
	
	way that is provably close to optimal. This leads to estimators that
	have low variance for
	
	a broad class of integrands. We also describe a new variance reduction
	technique called
	
	efficiency-optimized Russian roulette.
	
	Finally, we link these ideas together to obtain new Monte Carlo light
	transport algorithms.
	
	Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling
	techniques that
	
	generate some path vertices starting from a light source, and some
	starting from a sensor.
	
	We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance
	sampling, a
	
	large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently.
	The algorithm is unbiased,
	
	handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and is relatively simple
	to implement.
	
	The second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport, inspired
	by the Metropolis
	
	sampling method from computational physics. Paths are generated by
	following a
	
	random walk through path space, such that the probability density
	of visiting each path is
	
	proportional to the contribution it makes to the ideal image. The
	resulting algorithm is unbiased,
	
	uses little storage, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and
	can be orders of
	
	magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches. It performs
	especially well
	
	on problems that are usually considered difficult, e.g. those involving
	bright indirect light,
	
	small geometric holes, or glossy surfaces. To our knowledge, this
	is the first application of
	
	the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind.},

  abstract = {The introduction of modern GPUs such as the GeForce 256 and GeForce2
	GTS has opened the door for creating stunningly photorealistc interactive
	3D content. While the realization of realtime computer-generated
	images indistinguishable from photographs remains as yet unreached,
	one piece of machinery that will play an important role in realising
	interactive photorealism is the notion of a Bi-directional Reflectance
	Distribution Function (BRDF) and BRDF-based lighting techniques.
	
	The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a working knowledge of
	the concepts and basic mathematics necessary to appreciate BRDFs
	and to provide some exposure to the terminology used when discussing
	BRDFs and BRDF-based lighting techniques. If you are already familiar
	with BRDFs, this paper will be a review; however, if you are new
	to BRDFs, this paper will provide a good starting point for understanding
	many reflectancebased lighting techniques.},

  abstract = {The Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT) is a collection of interfaces
	and reference implementations of numerical objects useful for scientific
	computing in C++. The toolkit defines interfaces for basic data structures,
	such as multidimensional arrays and sparse matrices, commonly used
	in numerical applications. The goal of this package is to provide
	reusable software components that address many of the portability
	and maintennace problems with C++ codes.
	
	TNT provides a distinction between interfaces and implementations
	of TNT components. For example, there is a TNT interface for two-dimensional
	arrays which describes how individual elements are accessed and how
	certain information, such as the array dimensions, can be used in
	algorithms; however, there can be several implementations of such
	an interface: one that uses expression templates, or one that uses
	BLAS kernels, or another that is instrumented to provide debugging
	information. By specifying only the interface, applications codes
	may utilize such algorithms, while giving library developers the
	greatest flexibility in employing optimization or portability strategies.}

	It can help you in three ways:
	
	
	- It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or
	an off-line reference manual (in $\mbox{\LaTeX}$) from a set of documented
	source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF
	(MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix
	man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources,
	which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with
	the source code.
	
	- You can configure doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented
	source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large
	source distributions. You can also visualize the relations between
	the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance
	diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.
	
	- You can also use doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I
	did for this manual).
	
	
	Doxygen is developed under Linux and Mac OS X, but is set-up to be
	highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors
	as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.}

  abstract = {While a number of different shading languages have been developed,
	their efficient integration into an existing renderer is notoriously
	difficult, often boiling down to implementing an entire compiler
	toolchain for each language. Furthermore, no shading language is
	broadly supported across the variety of rendering systems. AnySL
	attacks this issue from multiple directions: We compile shaders from
	different languages into a common, portable representation, which
	uses subroutine threaded code: Every language operator is translated
	to a function call. Thus, the compiled shader is generic with respect
	to the used types and operators. The key component of our system
	is an embedded compiler that instantiates this generic code in terms
	of the renderer's native types and operations. It allows for flexible
	code transformations to match the internal structure of the renderer
	and eliminates all overhead due to the subroutine threaded code.
	For SIMD architectures we automatically perform vectorization of
	scalar shaders which speeds up rendering by a factor of 3.9 on average
	on SSE. The results are highly optimized, parallel shaders that operate
	directly on the internal data structures of a renderer. We show that
	both traditional shading languages such as RenderMan, but also C/C++-based
	shading languages, can be fully supported and deliver high performance
	across different CPU renderers.},
