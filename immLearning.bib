  abstract  = {In the midst of growing transformation, many within higher education cling resolutely to more familiar structures and delivery models, having little but a cursory regard to the events which are unfolding. This paper seeks to highlight the various potencies which are hastening fundamental change within higher education, particularly with regard to the provision of continuing professional development. It encourages the adaptation of appropriate pedagogies designed specifically to facilitate technology-enhanced teaching and learning methodologies, reflecting the cognitive and collaborative learning modes of current and future learners. Ultimately, the evidential content suggests the necessity to embrace educational technological affordances in order to support the evolution of higher education.},

  abstract = {In the past, the term e-learning referred to any method of learning that used electronic delivery methods. With the advent of the Internet however, e-learning has evolved and the term is now most commonly used to refer to online courses. A multitude of systems are now available to manage and deliver learning content online. While these have proved popular, they are often single-user learning environments which provide little in the way of interaction or stimulation for the student. As the concept of lifelong learning now becomes a reality and thus more and more people are partaking in online courses, researchers are constantly exploring innovative techniques to motivate online students and enhance the e-learning experience. This article presents our research in this area and the resulting development of CLEV-R, a Collaborative Learning Environment with Virtual Reality. This web-based system uses Virtual Reality (VR) and multimedia and provides communication tools to support collaboration among students. In this article, we describe the features of CLEV-R, its adaptation for mobile devices and present the findings from an initial evaluation.},
